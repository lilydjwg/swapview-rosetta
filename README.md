Contributions
----

Contributions are welcome! Improve current ones, or submit new one. But make
sure your implementations meet the following requirements:

1. Must be readable and maintainable
2. Output exact the same format as other versions (but sorting may be
   unstable)
3. Try to be efficient
4. Please include a `Makefile` if appropriate
5. Don't forget to tell the compiler to optimize
